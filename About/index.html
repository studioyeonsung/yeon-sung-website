    <h2>About</h2>
    
    <p>ARCHIVE OF MATTER(S) is an artistic research platform run by an artist researcher Yeon Sung,  
    working on, with, through Matters.</p>

    <p>↳ Concept/Design: Yeon Sung<br>
    ↳ Web development: Yeon Sung & Nami Kim</p>

    <p>Yeon Sung 연성 is an artist-researcher  
    working — on, with, and through — Matter(s).  
    As a child of a generation traumatized by  
    Japanese colonial occupation, her practice  
    critically engages with colonial legacies at the  
    intersection of sociopolitics, environment,  
    and technology — all refracted through the  
    lens of Matter(s).</p>

    <p>Using DO-IT-YOURSELF (DIY) tools and  
    performances involving accessible  
    technology and embodied participation, she  
    experiments with performance as a  
    decolonial method — one that challenges  
    dominant power structures and democratizes  
    aesthetic experience.</p>

    <p>She currently runs the artistic research  
    platform Archive of Matter(s) — archiveofmatters.com</p>

    <p><strong>Tracing Clouds of Dust, Copper, and Cherry Blossom: Traversing the Nonhuman and the Spatiotemporal</strong></p>

    <p>My artistic research traverses space and time to trace the lingering presence of colonialism embedded in society and the environment.  
    Through nonhuman narratives, I seek to restore the silenced and omitted histories of colonialism.</p>

    <p>The story begins with the cherry blossom trees of my hometown, Changwon, and the bronze Atlas statue of the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.  
    When I recognized the shared imperial subject that grafted militarism onto the cherry blossoms and forged the bronze Atlas,  
    I resolved to give voice to nonhuman beings.</p>

    <p>Through the trilogy project “The Matter Trilogy,” nonhuman substances like copper and dust  
    become narrators and agents of the narrative.  
    They do not serve as mere tools or mediums for expression, but as living, vital agents of power and as enduring conductors of colonial infrastructure.  
    The nonhuman body that crosses ecological catastrophes and the histories of empire,  
    I focus on the forgotten traces—often invisible and inaudible—and excavate hidden existences.</p>
