      <p>In the project Rusty Odyssey, copper becomes a protagonist that rewrites Eurocentric historical narratives, tracing the intertwined routes of the Netherlands, Japan, and Korea into an alternative cartography of inherited colonial capitalism.</p>
      <p>This project grounds itself on a layered foundation of research essays, reimagining copper not simply as a mineral but as a human agent animated by capital’s circulations. Copper, thus, becomes a medium through which decolonial discourse is not represented, but experimentally re-formed.</p>
      <p>The practice traverses multiple registers—experimental documentary, installation, and textual research—each unfolding different sensory, material, and political dimensions of copper. Through this multi-modal engagement, Rusty Odyssey invites a re-sensing of history: one in which matter itself remembers, carries, and resists inherited violence.</p>

                  Rusty Odyssey depicts the colonial faces of three copper coins (VOC Duit,
                  Japanese Sen, and Euro coin) tracing their guilty chronicle from the 18th
                  century till the present day in the Netherlands, Japan, and Korea.
                  Transcending time and territories, the film cuts the temporal dimension
                  of the geographies where the coins were born and follows the
                  transformation of the monetary material as vitalized by capital.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rusty Odyssey reveals the colonial phantom behind the faces of the
                  coins through the sites in which history is staged. The fluctuating
                  heartbeat of copper—an inheritor of colonial capitalism—still lives on.
